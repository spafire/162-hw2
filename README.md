Simple Game Arcade Website

This project is a simple game arcade website built using client-side Javascript featuring 3 widely known games: Tic-Tac-Toe, the Snake Game, and Hangman. It is built using multiple pages for simplicity and allows for each game to be maintained separately. The site maintains a minimalist visual style throughout and incorporates simple color contrast and hover features to enhance navigation and usability. 


Refactoring and Integrattion

The Tic-Tac-Toe game was taken from the course example, with minimal modifications other than few changings in the styling and layout to match the site design, and extra documention for my own understanding. 

The Snake Game is an open source game by AsmrProg-YT. The lines that checked for collision of the snake was refactored into a function. Previously, after the game ended, an alert would pop up to restart the game. This was modified so that the phrase "Game Over!" would appear across the screen and a "Play again" button is available to restart the game. In addition, new stylistic choices such as the grid size of the game and colors were modified to match the site design.

The Hangman game is similar to the original classic game except the a part of the hangman disappears for each letter guessed incorrect. It makes use of functions to make the code easier to manage and maintain.
